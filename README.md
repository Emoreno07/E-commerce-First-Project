<p>My first school Project as Web Developer. learning project</p>

<h1>USING THE SITE</h1>

<p>
since i am not hosting this, clone the repository to use it. items are static and they are for estetic purposes only
</p>
<p>
open the folder in a server(the server MUST listen to E-COMMERCE-FIRST-PROJECT folder i.e it must be the root folder, otherwise there might be css breaking changes)
for vscode liveserver, use liveserver with E-COMMERCE-FIRST-PROJECT as root directory, otherwise breaking css changes might appear.
